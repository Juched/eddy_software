## The Eddy AUV Software Platform   

This repository is the secondary codebase for the Underwater Robotics Team at The Ohio State University. Our mission is to develop the software which powers our Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. The software in this repository is designed for our test vehicle, Eddy, and is written purely by our newest members to learn basic data processing and controls algorithms. All built on the Robot Operating System framework.
